Wordconfusion A tutorial project for DJango 1.3 and JQuery
----------------------------------------------------------

This is a Django app that can be cloned into a Django 1.3 project.

To start from scratch:

1) Make sure Django 1.3 is installed
2) django-admin.py startproject <proj>
3) cd <proj>
4) git clone git@github.com:jarv/wordconfuse.git

After you make your local changes to settings.py
and urls.py (see below) do the following to launch
the local webserver:

$ python manage.py syncdb
$ python manage.py collectstatic
$ python manage.py runserver

Syncdb will take awhile to run since it is creating
a large table with all the words for the game.

For more info see the detailed tutorial @ http://jarv.org

Django Setup notes
-------------------

    Database:

    You will need to let Django know about your database,
    if you are running a local instance the simplest thing
    to do is use sqlite.

    Staticfiles:

    You will need to let Django know where you want to put
    static files.  Make sure STATIC_ROOT and STATIC_URL are
    set in settings.py


    URLs:

    Here is the setup for URL patterns:


    from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView

    ...

    urlpatterns += patterns('wordconfuse.views',
        (r'^$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name="index.html")),
        url(r'^get_words$', 'get_words', name='get_words'),
        url(r'^gameover$', 'gameover', name='gameover'),
        url(r'^new_hs$', 'new_hs', name='new_hs'),
        url(r'^hs$', 'hs', name='hs'),
        )
    urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()
